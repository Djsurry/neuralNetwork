# Neural Network
My first neural network. It takes in a 2x2 pixel image and then decides if it is full of white-ish pixels, empty of white-ish pixels, has a horizontal line or vertical line or diagonal line. I know it's simple and sort of useless but this is my first attempt at understanding and created one.

# Things I want to add
 - Scaling. I want to make this take in a 10x10 image and try to find specific shapes
 - A training system that changes the exact value of the weights with a genetic algorithm to maximize its effectiveness. In a hypothetical senario it would take in an image and the correct answer for that image. Thats how it finds the fitness. This is the reason weights.json exists.
 - A visualization using pygame. I have already built some of the framework and I just need to illustrate it. This will probably be much later or never come, as I dont enjoy this type of thing very much although I do think it would be cool
